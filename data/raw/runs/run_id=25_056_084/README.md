I believe that the continuum files here are low S/N exposures, which Daniel takes the centre of to get raster images.

These would be used to locate the wavelength of the dichroic features, and these exposures would be comined with a dedicated
high S/N continuum exposure from earlier/later in the night to get the final high S/N continuum with dichroic features
at the correct wavelength.
